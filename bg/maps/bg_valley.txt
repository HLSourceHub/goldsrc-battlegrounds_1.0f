Story written by Render and edited by Ben
--------------------------------------------------------------

A British platoon is patrolling near a road when an unexpected 
cave-in cuts them off from the rest of their Regiment.  
They have to traverse through a valley, which has not been 
secured by the British yet.  They soon realize that they 
have stumbled upon a colonial infested valley.

OBJECTIVES:

British:
Go down the valley and secure the area so you can reunite 
with your regiment regiment.

Americans:
You must eliminate all soldiers in the British platoon, 
as they now know the location of a crucial colonial camp.
