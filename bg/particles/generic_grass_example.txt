// All settings start with the setting name.  The actual setting value follows after a space.
// Each setting must be on a new line.  An example of a setting can be seen below

// Below I will give an example of a fully fleshed out grass particle system
// There are some comments after some settings. 
// These comments are no substitute for the guide, which explains all this in much more detail

// Path to the image for this particle

// The starting size of the particle multiplied with 30 in the code, 
// so 1.0 means 30 hl units what is compareable to something like 50cm.
scale 30.0

// The Maximum amount a particle can lean
leaning_max 90.0

// The Minimum amount a particle can lean
leaning_min 45.0

// How fast the wind is moving
wave_speed 0.0

//  The Number of particles spawned by the emitter when the map is loaded
particles 20

// Is the maximum transparency of a particle.
// 255 = totally solid
// 0 = totally see through, invisible
// It's a sliding scale inbetween
transparency 255

// Particles further away from the user aren't rendered saving them fps
lod 1

// Grass particles find the ground below them.  Highly Recommended to leave on 1
drop_on_ground 1

// Particles for this system won't be sorted, meaning particles behind them may be drawn infront
// With most grass particles the difference between drawn infront of and drawn behind can't be seen
// This is a good optimisation technique in those cases
ignore_sort 1

// When the game sees new_particle it creates a new particle type
// This new particle type can have all new settings
// Your func_grass can contain as many different types as you like
// Each type is independant of each other, with regards to number of particles
// particle texture, wind speed, etc
