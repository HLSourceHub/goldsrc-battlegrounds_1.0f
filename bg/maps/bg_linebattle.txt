Linebattle

18th century warfare was much unlike today's. 
Large formations of men moved and fought as one unit, 
and the army with the best discipline had a good chance of winning. 
The characteristics of the musket meant a lot for how tactics were developed. 
The reloading procedure made coordination important, 
so the soldiers wouldn't interfere with each other, 
and the slow rate of fire meant commanders tried different methods
to keep lead flying at all times in sustained fire.

The by modern standards inaccurate and short ranged weapons meant
that the opposing forces would advance close to each other before firing. 
The close formations were needed for the gunfire to have effect. 
Shooting, however, was no means of gaining ground. 
This was done by bayonet charge,
after softening the opponent with artillery and musket fire.
