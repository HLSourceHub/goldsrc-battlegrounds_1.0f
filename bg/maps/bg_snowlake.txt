Story written by Ben
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Americans have been pressed back all winter.  
The British Army is constantly advancing and forcing 
colonial troops all winder.  The colonials are desperately 
trying to hold the British off and now von Steuben has 
arrived to provide aid to their cause.  The losses through 
the winter have been high.  Hungry and dispirited the 
colonial now have a chance to strike back and cut off the 
British supply lines.  If they can stop the British 
from advancing past the lake and into the town, then 
the British will be without their valuable supplies and the 
colonial troops will be well equipped and well fed ready for 
Battles in the New Year.  However, if the British do manage 
to capture the lake and the town ahead, the colonials will 
have lost a valuable chance to strike back and the 
constant attacks from the British will continue through 
the rest of the winter.

OBJECTIVES

British:
Capture the lake and the colonial camping grounds.  
We need those supplies.  Also managing to crush the 
colonials now, we can deliver a blow which will 
totally demoralise them.

Americans:
Holding the lake is imperative if we are to stop the 
British from finishing this war quickly in this winter.  
By cutting off their supply lines, we will be well 
equipped to fight them in the New Year.
