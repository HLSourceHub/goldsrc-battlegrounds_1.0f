Continental Infantry

The Regular Army of the new American nation.  While not as disciplined or well trained as the Royal Infantry, they are the only ones who would stand a chance against them in open battle.  They carry a surplus French musket, the .69 calibre 1766 Charleville, an inaccurate but hard-hitting piece of weaponry.  Like their British counterparts, they also move slower than the light infantry units, such as the Minutemen.
