BG_LEXINGTON BY Predator and Render
Textures by several people including BlackPanther, Pr3dator, Render
Models by Sgt.Pepper and BlackPanther
Story written by Predator and edited by Ben
--------------------------------------------------------------

Objectives:

	Each side must push the opposition back to their starting locations
in order to take control of Lexington.  The Field and the Hill are the most important capture area
and therefore awards its owner with more points than any other capture areas.

Special Thanks:

Render - For the orignal idea, rmf, textures, and help.
