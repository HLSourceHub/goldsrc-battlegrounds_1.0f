Loyalist

The Loyalist is an American who does not support the claim for independence, and has decided to fight for the Crown.  Like their rebel counterparts - the militia - they are considered light infantry and move relatively fast.  They carry a hunting weapon, the famous Pennsylvania long rifle.  It fires a .50 calibre lead ball through the rifled barrel, which makes it more accurate than the smoothbores, but the small calibre does not do as much damage as the military muskets.  The Loyalist also carries a hunting knife for personal defence.
