Story written by Render and edited by Ben
--------------------------------------------------------------

British intelligence reports, that a colonial camp lies near 
a choke point where the British can cut off the 
colonial’s supply-line.  It needs to be captured to achieve 
an easy end to a fearsome enemy camp.  Both sides are 
rallying to it, not knowing if, or when the enemy soldiers 
will arrive, but all fear that a Line Battle is imminent.

OBJECTIVES:

British:
There can be only one winner, so see to it that the 
colonial dogs will taste your bayonet, if they try to 
resist your superior regiment.

Americans:
Patriotic or not, you cannot let the British capture 
this chokepoint, for that would be the beginning of a long 
starvation period.  Fight well and you will live 
to see another day.
