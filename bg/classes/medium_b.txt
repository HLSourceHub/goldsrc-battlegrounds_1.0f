Royal Infantry

The Royal Infantry are perhaps the finest and most disciplined group of soldiers in the world.  They are almost impossible to beat in an open field battle.  Their main weapon is the venerable Short Land Pattern musket, commonly known as the "Brown Bess".  It is an inaccurate, but hard hitting .75 calibre smoothbore, equipped with a lethal bayonet.  Being weighed down by personal equipment, and a heavy musket, they are quite slow moving, but once they come within range, danger is imminent.
