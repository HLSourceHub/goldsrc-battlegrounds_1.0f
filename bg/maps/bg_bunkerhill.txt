--------------------------------------------------------------

	After retreating from Lexington in 1775, the British
occupied Boston.  Realizing the need to strengthen their
position in Boston, plans were developed to seize and fortify
nearby Dorchesyer Heights and Charlestown peninsulas (the
area surrounding Bunker Hill.)  This area provided a commanding
view of the seaport and harbor in Boston.  All the British needed
to easily occupy Boston was to set up a command post on the
nearby hills.  Unfortunately, the Americans in the area discovered
the British plans and fortified the hills before the British could.  
The British saw the fortifications the next day and realized that
the Americans were there to stay, and thus the battle of Bunker
Hill began.

OBJECTIVES:

British:
Take control of the hill from the rebels, at all costs, in
order to better command Boston.  Try to find every way into the
fort to make it easier to win.  To take the fort, simply hold the
areas around the front walls for 15 seconds.

Americans:
Guard the fort from the British at all costs.  Points are
for how long the Americans can hold of the Brtish.
