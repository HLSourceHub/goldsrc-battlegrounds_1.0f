Story written by Predator and edited by Ben
--------------------------------------------------------------

       	The American rebel scouts have stumbled upon a British
supply line that follows a forest road.  This area is a key factor
in winning the war for the British.  They are determined to destroy these
pesky rebels once and for all in order to save their supply line.  The British
troops follow the rebles through the forest and America scouts, on the retreat,
blocked the road with anything they could find to stop British supplies from
getting through.  Both sides need the road to have a better preparedness for
battles to come.

Objectives:

	Each side must push the opposition back to their starting locations
in order to take control of the road.  The Bridge is the most important capture area
and therefore awards its owner with more points than any other capture areas.
