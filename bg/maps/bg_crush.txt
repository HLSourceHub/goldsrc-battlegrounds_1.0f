The Revolutionary Forces are garrisoned in a wooden fortress in the wilderness, and the British forces are encamped in a nearby town.  Both sides are uneasy about the enemy presence in the area and a fierce battle ensues.

OBJECTIVES:

British:
Proceed from the town and engage the traitors on the battlefield.  Once they scatter persue them to the fort and capture it!  God save the King!

Americans:
Stop the British from getting near the fort, but if a retreat is needed, defend the fort at all costs!
