Green Spring, VA, July 27, 1781

The 33rd Regiment defeated the local Virginia Militia.  
This has forced the Virginia Militia to retreat, to the 
nearest Continental Army Headquarters.  Scouts from the 
33rd Regiment, found the Militia's location and have reported 
to the Colonel of the Regiment.  As a response to the 
discovery of the Continental Army Headquarters, the Colonel 
ordered an attack on the militia and the headquarters.  
Loggers near the town witnessed the British setting up camp 
in a forest just outside the town.  They reported this to 
the Continental Army.  Without hesitation, the 
Continental Army assembled their troops, and was ready for 
the attack by nightfall.  With no further delay, the shots 
were fired and the battle had begun.

OBJECTIVES:

British:
Finish off the Virginia Militia and ransack the 
Colonial Army Headquarters in this area.

Americans:
The Colonial Army Headquarters contains valuable intelligence, 
which would surely aid the British.  Protect the 
Headquarters with your life
