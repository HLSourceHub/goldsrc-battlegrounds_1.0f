Minutemen

The Minutemen are a part of the militia, but are better trained, and better equipped than the regular farmers and townsfolk.  They are ready to turn up for defence "within a minute's notice".  They are not as well drilled as the regular soldiers, and are considered light infantry.  They carry a French musket, the .69 calibre 1777 Revolutionnaire, which gives a balance between accuracy and damage.  The musket is also equipped with a bayonet.
